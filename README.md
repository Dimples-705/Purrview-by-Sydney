# Purrview by Sydney
An ai and Javascipt powered Chrome and Firefox Extention that summarizes webpage article's and emails. 

This Repo is just a proof of concept and is used as a reference for Purrview by Sydney Beta Version 1.1.  

The code may not function as intended.  It is still in the developmental phase and preparing to be launched on the Chrome Developer Account and Chrome Extention Marketplace in Fall of 2025.  Thank you for your patience.

## Notes
- Long pages are chunked; abstractive mode summarizes chunks and then compresses again for a clean global summary.
- Everything is MV3â€‘compatible and works in current Firefox.
- You can later wire in a hosted LLM via the Options page if you decide to (keys stored in <code>storage.local</code>).
